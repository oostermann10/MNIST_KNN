Used a KNN classifier model to achieve 97% accuracy on the MNIST dataset. Used grid search and cross validation to hyper-tune the number of neighbours and the distance parameters for the model. The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. The database is also widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning.
